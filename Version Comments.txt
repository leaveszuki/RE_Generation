(1)	combine old XTRACT and new XTRACTPro into one project
(2)	implement export cost matrix to .CSV and run optimization python program directly.
(3)     implement simplification of regular expressions, including remove repetitive brackets. Then fix the bug of the absence of brackets between regular expression segment and the head sign^ and the tail sign $.(2017/11/12)
(4)     seperate the cost file .CSV into two different files r.CSV and s.CSV that is easy to use for genetic algorithm based optimization.
